In first step, we would like to infer whether samples of sensor data form segregated clusters in the space spanned by the sensor features.
Since the number of features are relatively large to visualize, first principal components analysis (PCA) performed.

In second step, we will be testing two separate models for this purpose: a support-vectormachine (SVM) classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier
